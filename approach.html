            <p>People describe me as cunning, courageous and confident. They also say I have a 
                "tendency to ignore Starfleet regulations" when I feel the end justifies the means. And they're not wrong.
                But everything I do is about the ship and the crew.</p>

            <p> When it comes to talking about my skills, I'm not the type to just
                throw out a dry little list. I like to let my past experience speak for itself. Here's
                a small sample of what I've done lately, and how I've done it. </p>
            <div id="skilllist">
                <p id="skill1">Beat a Vulcan at chess through pure psychology--understanding how he thinks and using that to my advantage.</p>
                <p id="skill2">Reprogrammed the Kobayashi Maru (some call it cheating) and became the first person to win the simulation.</p>
                <p id="skill3">Saved a planet from total destruction by managing to find two extinct whales. Could you do that? On my team, you bet.</p>
